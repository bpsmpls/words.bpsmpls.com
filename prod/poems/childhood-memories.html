                <p>Sometimes I’ll get caught up in a good memory<br />
                    From when I was a young kid.<br />
                    Not unlike a dream, many details cloudy yet vivid.<br />
                    But as if the wrong note was struck on a piano mid-progression,<br />
                    A color takes over the dream.</p>
                <p>I’ll remember the circumstances surrounding the good<br />
                    And shame poisons the moment.<br />
                    You weren’t giving me an allowance,<br />
                    You were bribing me.<br />
                    You weren’t asking me to join you up north to see me more,<br />
                    But to make her see me less.</p>
                <p>Most of my life I looked at as as normal of an upbringing as one could have,<br />
                    But the reality was that I made do with what I was given.<br />
                    Given your circumstances, people will paraphrase,<br />
                    You’re really quite well-adjusted.</p>
                <p>Realistically though<br />
                    I’m just coming to terms with damage that’s long been done.<br />
                    Over and over.<br />
                    For years and years.<br />
                    I will lay in bed at night<br />
                    Terrified for my past self,<br />
                    Wishing I could be there to comfort him,<br />
                    Or to pull him out of the situations he was in.</p>
                <p>There is a trite saying: nobody’s perfect.<br />
                    Everybody seemed to refer to that as I grew up.<br />
                    Whoever shrieked the most violently won.<br />
                    Whoever grappled and neutralized the other fastest won.</p>
                <p>My room was my only safe place.<br />
                    A small place with all of my things,<br />
                    All of my distractions.<br />
                    Loud things that could drown out a cacophony of anger outside.</p>
                <p>A dismissive air afterwards where we act like nothing happened.<br />
                    We sit down to dinner and look at our food<br />
                    And the adults smile and force small talk.<br />
                    You just got finished calling him a worthless vulture,<br />
                    My mashed potatoes are fine.<br />
                    I heard the sharp echoes of your psychotic outburst.<br />
                    The walls aren’t that thick.<br />
                    Don’t pretend like the spaghetti is the only thing going on.<br />
                    I wonder if it was the alcohol that brought this out in you<br />
                    Or if it’s being sober and paranoid of it that keeps it in.</p>
                <p>Mom and Dad aren’t so different behind it all.<br />
                    And how far from the tree does the apple typically fall?</p>
