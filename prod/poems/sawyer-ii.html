                <p>Open with a joke just to see where it’ll land<br />
                    But missing gear, it couldn’t safely roll in<br />
                    On approach, the joke tipped to the right a bit hard<br />
                    And burned fast in the crash greeting it.<br />
                    She told him she was being sarcastic<br />
                    But he didn’t think she knew what that meant<br />
                    She told him he didn’t get her humor<br />
                    Boy, did he agree</p>
                <p>Because she chose what to see and projected what she liked<br />
                    Her disappointment inside her grew<br />
                    And if every man she laid in bed with understood her immediately<br />
                    There’d only have been just a few</p>
                <p>She’s conflating a kindness with knowing<br />
                    He assumed she was wiser than he<br />
                    Her desire to be close and desired<br />
                    Manifested by pushing him away </p>
                <p>It hadn’t been that long by then yet they were drained<br />
                    By every conversation they could have<br />
                    Confused and comparing to what they’d expected<br />
                    How could it have unraveled so fast?</p>
                <p>She could feel it, and so could he.<br />
                    Every sentence between them was a chore<br />
                    They released the grasp that had been slipping<br />
                    Agreeing together that it wasn’t worth it anymore</p>
