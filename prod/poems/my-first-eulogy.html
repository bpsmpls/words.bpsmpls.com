                <p>It may be 6 a.m. somewhere<br />
                    But it's one o'clock here<br />
                    I can't stop thinking<br />
                    I can't stop remembering<br />
                    You've already been gone<br />
                    For a lifetime<br />
                    And the one that you filled<br />
                    At its end<br />
                    In the box<br />
                    Amounts to a life threefold.</p>
                <p>You never knew how much pain you could cause.<br />
                    A life spent in misery<br />
                    Bringing happiness around with him<br />
                    Instead of inside of him.<br />
                    A life spent in experience<br />
                    Not in slavery to the status quo<br />
                    Hard pressed into literature<br />
                    Of outstanding magnitude,<br />
                    While in a train car<br />
                    Filled with the homeless<br />
                    Along the landscape<br />
                    Of the entire country<br />
                    Thinking only<br />
                    How much he loves the freedom.</p>
                <p>A life spent without<br />
                    The American dream,<br />
                    Rather stretched into<br />
                    The American Imagination.<br />
                    If all substance is formed of strings<br />
                    And all life supported by selfishness<br />
                    And all selfishness dependent on survival<br />
                    You depend on your seclusion to be your downfall.<br />
                    Survival Destructo.</p>
                <p>The broken man<br />
                    Free from everything but himself<br />
                    Rode his dirty horse<br />
                    Around the ranch.<br />
                    Stopping only for a few <br />
                    Precious moments.<br />
                    Precision marked by a perfect once-over.<br />
                    Decisions marked by a curious understanding.<br />
                    Conversation marked by a responsive listener.<br />
                    Altercations transition a friendship's development.<br />
                    The tired man<br />
                    Wasting time trying to sleep<br />
                    Dives beneath the surface.<br />
                    Pushing downward and forward.<br />
                    Hiding more from others,<br />
                    Pushing more on himself.<br />
                    The distant man<br />
                    Looking for something new<br />
                    Finds a gem in the sand<br />
                    Almost every time<br />
                    He looks around.</p>
                <p>The independence,<br />
                    The sacrifice,<br />
                    The space,<br />
                    The love<br />
                    The hate<br />
                    And everything,<br />
                    Falls under an Earley gene.<br />
                    They scrounge for a bit of experience<br />
                    They dive into wombs of unfamiliarity.<br />
                    They think with their hearts,<br />
                    But decide with their mind.</p>
                <p>A soulful man<br />
                    Ends his time<br />
                    Facing a sign<br />
                    That leaves his note.<br />
                    The sign reads<br />
                    Dead end<br />
                    He hopes they'll know what he means<br />
                    He hopes that he will be missed<br />
                    He hopes that it frees him<br />
                    He hopes that it's right<br />
                    He says that some will get it.<br />
                    He says that he's forgotten<br />
                    He says his prison's opening<br />
                    By the work to his left<br />
                    That pours his peace into the car<br />
                    He closes his eyes<br />
                    His face washing from angst<br />
                    Underneath the water<br />
                    Underneath his foam<br />
                    The serene emerges<br />
                    In a tearful goodbye<br />
                    Alone in the night<br />
                    He sings to himself:</p>
                <p>*{<br />
                    Everything comes together again<br />
                    Does this pale figure offend<br />
                    Show me the way under your skin<br />
                    Don’t inhale, don’t excite<br />
                    Maybe the dark is really the light<br />
                    Covered in shame, dirt and a dress<br />
                    Not any good, not any bad, just give it a rest<br />
                    Dug his own grave with the choices he made now he’s dead<br />
                    Nothing has changed it’s still the same was he ever alive<br />
                    I’ve said it before I’ll say it again I’m tired of this<br />
                    I don’t think about it<br />
                    I don’t talk about it<br />
                    I don’t dream about it<br />
                    Not anymore<br />
                    }</p>
