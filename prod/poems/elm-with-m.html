            <div class="entryDetail_body">
                <p>The air is quiet<br />
                    Like the area is completely abandoned.<br />
                    Just me and M.<br />
                    The fresh snow drifting down from above us,<br />
                    Gently compacting under our tires,<br />
                    A muffled chewing sound with each pedal stroke. </p>
                <p>It's dusk and the trail is still brighter than any dry season day.<br />
                    The hardpack base is banked and scooped along the edges of the trail. <br />
                    We have a firm bobsled run to bank off. <br />
                    I keep chuckling loudly, to no one in particular.<br />
                    I frequently contort to check on M,<br />
                    Mostly to react to her playful hoots and hollers.<br />
                    I almost always lose my line when untwisting forward<br />
                    Laughing as I plant a foot in the high snow above the trail to keep my balance.</p>
                <p>The trees are bare and still.<br />
                    The trail is so open this time of year.<br />
                    I can see everything. <br />
                    Deep into the woods,<br />
                    All the pristine nothingness that's usually hidden behind needles and leaves, thicket and brush.<br />
                    It's oddly secluded. <br />
                    Though far through the trees, I spot another rider every so often.<br />
                    I wonder if they notice us,<br />
                    Or if our giggles are muffled enough by these light flurries.</p>
                <p>Families of deer crowd the edges of the trail<br />
                    Like they're spectating a parade of two.<br />
                    Some sneak into the action to be chased off.<br />
                    Others cross and look back.<br />
                    And they all eventually halt<br />
                    And stiffly watch us pass.</p>
                <p>Two-wheel drifting through corners,<br />
                    My left pinky numbs first.<br />
                    It suffered some ugly frostnip years back, so it always cools the quickest.<br />
                    When we stop at intersections, our chats get shorter.<br />
                    My chuckles stay hearty, but my face slurs all my words.<br />
                    I'm slowly icing over from the neck up.<br />
                    M however is radiating like a tanning bed.<br />
                    She's laughing about how sweaty she is. <br />
                    My fingers pressed against her face burn us both oppositely.<br />
                    Her kiss on my cheek thaws half my face for a second.<br />
                    We make our final descent to the trailhead.<br />
                    M calls out from behind me,<br />
                    "How lucky are we?"</p>
