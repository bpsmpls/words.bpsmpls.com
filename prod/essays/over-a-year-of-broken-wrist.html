                <p>Today is the one year anniversary for fracturing my wrist, the scaphoid specifically. In that time, I’ve had a cumulative four months in a various casts, three splints, 45 days using a Palm Pilot-sized science magic bone stimulator twice a day, five weeks of occupational therapy, two different wrist braces worn on and off for six months, and one surgery grafting bone from my hip in hopes of fixing the eroding scaphoid.</p>
                <p>In that time, I have learned and grown familiar with some things.</p>
                <p>One thing I’ve grown accustom to is pain. Even in my skateboarding years, pain was an inevitable component. Always looming and eager, pain was always just one small mistake away from being anchored to me for sometimes weeks on end, signaling like a flashing neon sign that I was closed for repairs. Due to a somewhat freak chance incident, I once shattered my humerus, radius, and ulna at the elbow and spent the better half of a year regaining strength and mobility until I was well enough to jump back on the board. It gets sore when the weather changes and the rounded bump you see at the end of it is quite literally just flesh and bone, but it’s fine now and doesn’t bother me.</p>
                <p>The wrist fracture also was a freak accident. Well within my limits on the easiest and smallest jump line at the bike park, I was bucked off a new bike within twenty minutes of being there, within an hour of owning the bike I was riding. I thought for sure that it was only a sprain when it happened and decided I’d keep jumping, keeping light on the hands. My friend and I left about forty minutes later and we came away with some fun photos of the new bike day. I could barely bring the bike inside upon arriving home and wrapped it up and iced it right away. Urgent care and ER couldn’t tell me whether or not it was broken when I went in the next day and ortho confirmed it the following Tuesday. Three months in a cast and I was given instructions and a 90% estimation clean bill of health. Get after it again, my doctor told me.</p>
                <p>But this pain has been very different. Unlike the many times I’ve sprained my ankles, sometimes nearly snapping the ligaments that hold them together entirely, this wrist pain has not let up over time. The small ridges in the pavement on the Midtown Greenway near the soccer field hurt with the same dull swelling that a charliehorse to the shoulder might from your kind-of-overly-enthusiastically-aggressive friend after his third beer.</p>
                <p>I dialed back activities to cater to this pain. Drumming techniques that loosened the stiffness but didn’t aggravate were tough to develop. I couldn’t do a push up or a pull up due to the strain and sting it would cause. I could no longer carry a bike over my shoulder because that flexibility was no longer there and getting near it would make my hand go limp. I no longer bunny hopped up anything taller than a curb because I knew if I landed at all angled forward, I would not be able to ride home safely afterward. I developed techniques around these limitations so that I could still do what I love doing, though not progress with it while doing so, holding dearly to the little bit that I was capable of doing. It made every ride a higher calculation of risk, including grocery runs.</p>
                <p>But my doctor and my occupational therapist said that it was just stiff and that if I kept up my stretches and progressed with them, that would eventually go away. So I took their word on that my pain was not indicative of any serious issues regarding my injury and managed through it, faithful that it would eventually soften and I would be back to my normal self. When I would land hard and it would hurt—boy would it hurt—I would just stretch it out per the therapist’s instruction and wait for the pain to die down. It hurts now, but it’s just temporary and not a concern, I’d remind myself.</p>
                <p>Paired with the pain, I’ve become much more familiar with fear. Believe it or not, I’ve always lived with a lot of caution in the activities I do. Lots of careful consideration before action. But this caution has turned into heightened fear. All it has taken was a small unexpected bump or slightly shifted body weight when riding mountain bike trails or the dirt jumps at Cottage Grove for things to go very downhill from there. Granted, in a lot of ways that is how it always is and it’s that test of your balance, reaction, and stability that makes people like me do it. But the level of attack I’ve given my favorite things to do has come to a screeching halt.</p>
                <p>I would fantasize about visiting Ray’s Indoor MTB park in Milwaukee (RIP), Spirit Mountain in Duluth, or the Mega Cavern dirt jumps in Louisville and awe at the giant air people were getting and visualize myself doing it very clearly. Standard levels of risk are always involved with that and that’s the deal. But when successfully landing jumps of a much smaller scale with a soft, long-travel trail bike give me screaming pain, failure is almost incomprehensibly scary.</p>
                <p>Upon hearing of all of this again six months after the first large round of cast-free treatment and healing, my occupational therapist referred me to a surgeon, informing me that what I was experiencing was not normal after all. And the surgeon said that it was more broken than it was when I first fractured it. She continued, saying that there were a lot of unknowns about the possible success of any procedure but that it should relieve my daily pain and help stave off arthritis. The surgery involved cutting a cubic centimeter of bone from my hip and refactoring it into a scaphoid in my wrist.</p>
                <p>After the surgery, I couldn’t walk at all for a week without the desperate need for opioids and a cane. Going to the nearest restaurant two and a half blocks away meant 15 minutes of painstaking effort, taking every step two steps at a time. I was given a restriction with my wrist: no lifting, pushing, or pulling anything heavier than a pound. Toothbrushes and pants were the limit, they said. I was told this might not be the only surgery that I’ll need due to a unique complication, but we wouldn’t know for a couple months.</p>
                <p>I can walk now cane-free, which is amazing. I can cough and karaoke without crying now that the swelling and bruising of my abdomen has gone down. I’m not allowed to drive my stick-shift car because of the stress it’ll put on my wrist and possibility of dislodging the expensive work put into it.</p>
                <p>Today, the pain has not gone away, nor the fear. They’ve simply shifted. Now the pain is in my hip when I walk and in the palm of my right hand intermittently, where without consistency or warning nerves explode like firecrackers under my bright fiberglass protection. We’ve tried troubleshooting that by changing casts, but we don’t know what’s causing the pain. The nurses aren’t worried, but then again my first orthopedic doctor wasn’t worried either.</p>
                <p>More and more, the last year has been getting slower and more cautious, down to being careful about how you’ve placed the takeout bag in your right hand or how your elbow hangs when you type on the computer. All transportation has gotten more difficult, though I have had some amazing support from friends.</p>
                <p>Walking has become a lot more appealing. It’s very slow but then again with me, everything is right now. Things have to receive more time, focus, and energy to get done, but it’s put me in a semi-zen state. When I sold an old camera on Thursday to a young guy looking to get into photography, we met at Bob’s Java Hut near me. Before my buyer showed up I bought a cookie and the barista cheerfully probed for an update on my wrist. I had to get the cast changed that day because of the pain it caused me. She shook her head and praised my level-head in all of this. “You’re in such good spirits!” She exclaimed, “I don’t know how you do it.”</p>
                <p>I shrugged. Not much I can do about it. Lots of waiting; the body is a slow methodical healer and I’m learning a lot of patience.</p>
