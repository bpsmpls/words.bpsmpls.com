                <p>“I know we are now sworn commuting enemies,” Goose wrote to me mid-morning, “but want to ride back the whacky Bryant route?” But of course!</p>
                <p>We shared the swampy air of the afternoon ride from work on a hunt: the best roadside find you can haul by bike. There were prizes–probably–but also glory and adventure, also probably.</p>
                <p>We crossed the last highway bridge, rolling down by a mossy pond, where we were chewed lightly by its surrounding gravel before being spit out from the woods to a familiar alley. But in this alley sat something unfamiliar: an overflowing dumpster of goodies. Books, storm doors, vacuum cleaners, car batteries, tube TVs, and computers under layers of glass and sticky debris.</p>
                <p>And there we saw it. Frosty himself. The round and gregarious party host of winter spread out under a thin layer of trash, his white rump peeking out like a belt malfunction. We fished out his torso, permanently waving in all directions, and tried affixing it to Goose’s front rack. The struggle was both dumb and disgusting, with the logistics of the giant foam igloo with arms on a human-sized leg machine falling short and Frosty’s weathered leafy guts leaking out with every strap-tightening tumble.</p>
                <p>We resolved to dismember him, for the better of transport. Inelegantly, we stomped on the snow sultan’s shoulders and twisted his limbs until they gave way to an exploding foam cloud. And then he was easily affixed to both of our bike racks.</p>
                <p>Amidst the hustle, a man emerged from the backyard hauling additional car batteries. “Hello, sir!” Goose gleefully greeted. A shrugged grunt came back from the busied shirtless man. Goose went on hesitantly but politely to explain our situation and asked his permission to take his snowman’s body parts for work purposes.</p>
                <p>Unexpectedly, the man smiled wide to reveal a weathered grin and said, “oh, take him!” He jovially expelled just about every profane word I could name in the process and told us of a scrapper with a black hat that had nabbed Frosty’s head earlier that day.</p>
                <p>We thanked him for his garbage-related generosity and slow-rolled around the corner of the alley. In a flashpan idea, we spun around to ask if he’d pose for a picture with us to go with the story of our journey, but he had already vanished, leaving no evidence he was ever there. And so the rest of the ride home, Goose and I both had green-gloved hands actively waving pedestrians and cars along the bouncy potholed streets.</p>
