            <div class="entryDetail_body">
                <p>We set up camp on the eastern side of the route at a refurbished building that once had fallen into disrepair as a neighborhood drug den, which now housed a community of beautifully loving people. We set up tents that we didn’t use. We prepared for all the worst things. We’d never done it before.</p>
                <p>So we flew by the seat of our shorts down roads we’d become semi-familiar with during a few social gatherings and we did it in a pair of 2-hour shifts each among the six of us. Twenty-four hours, you know.</p>
                <p>We were so jittery that many of us rode alongside the first shift for a while, just because we needed to be a part of this bike action, soaking in the cheers of the neighborhood audience in their lawn chairs all the while. Cardboard cutouts of Elvira, homemade bike jumps, street chalk, bubbles, group cheers sewn so tightly onto the route that it should’ve wrinkled.</p>
                <p>When we satiated temporarily, we found ourselves creating a roaring cheer of noise with the home base house owner’s large musical instrument collection. Jingle bells, cowbells, ukeleles, foot drums, wood blocks… Even the steel bell that hung from the awning of the porch was not safe from the glockenspiel mallet while I dizzied myself with repeated train-whistle heaves. A passerby with a Smirnoffy speech impediment even welcomed himself to the party briefly.</p>
                <p>When that grew old and the porch party grew larger, a megaphone was placed in my hand and I was given full reign as the sanctioned 21st Ave Encouragement Catcaller. Riders and onlookers alike humored me with all of my errors in wit and excited absurdity.</p>
                <p>And as the night aged, partiers fled the porch in sleepiness, leaving an expired ruin of food, beer cans, and instruments. So too did my official shift close in. I’d been subbing for injured teammates victim of speed-related hiccups all night, but this time it was for true, and in the quietest, emptiest time of the cooling night. My 3am shift arrived.</p>
                <p>Another Cross Check-wielding cyclist with my same affinity for curb hopping taught me values in drafting, route redirection, and alley cat teamwork while we sailed the rolling seas of broken pavement throughout the neighborhood. We were dodging shadows in the night between street spotlights. Such spectres include my photographer friend while he was out on his third or fourth great search for a new vantage point along the route.</p><p>Shifts switched and as did my gears. I wound down trying to charge my phone with limited success in my car, accidentally catching a mouthful of Zs, waking a couple hours into my scheduled volunteer shift. Much to my simple fortune, my compassionate teammates had taken the shift themselves after seeing the state of my unrested slumber on a reclined and chewed up driver’s side bucket seat in a twenty-year-old sticker magnet that I drive to work.</p>
                <p>I was greeted with delight in the ‘morning’. In keeping with her motherly hospitality, our home base host fed us mint-wrapped cherry tomatoes and the amusing and storied history of that house she rented at. A quick jaunt to the central hub of the event on the Greenway delivered me some of Wheelhouse’s banana bread French toast, an anti-capitalist downtown Jimmy John’s bike courier’s conspiracy claims, and even some kindly syrup slurping from the curbside mid-conversation.</p>
                <p>Surveying the land of tents and campsites on this city event’s grounds, I found dozens of friends of mine strewn about in various states of sleep-deprived disarray. And the photographer was there to capture every cheery/groggy moment.</p>
                <p>I even had my first ever massage at a tent operating on donations, leading to the most delightful clay molding of my human composition and followed by a cash donation higher than I’d intended in an attempt to avoid Costanza-esque miscommunication catastrophe.</p>
                <p>And by the time my shift started again at 3 in the afternoon, the sun was a wicked hellfire in an oven. I stewed in a glaze of sweat showing up to my shift’s bonus activity in conversing with senior retirees in a community learning life lessons from a woman who started an unbroken train of multi-generational healthcare professionals lifetimes ago.</p>
                <p>I grasped at peanut butter pretzels as friends stamped my manifest at checkpoints, desperate for sustenance and a break from the self-imposed cycle-strain I’d employed. Water rained at me from the sides as the now wakeful and helpful community rooted everybody on, shaking sprinkler systems for heat conditioning. Friends catcalled encouragingly at my efforts passing through the fourth checkpoint with a power my legs hadn’t expected to have.</p>
                <p>And when it was all over, I collapsed like a long game of Jenga and melted like the last of snow on a hot spring day.</p>
                <p>Well we’d done it now. And we’ll do it again next year.</p>
                <p>So that’s me. How was your Powderhorn 24?</p>
