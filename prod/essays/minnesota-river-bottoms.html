                <p>I’m not sure where the start of the story really is. It might be in the morning where I installed my rear rack and panniers on my fat bike. It might be when I met with friends and went beer tasting in Golden Valley, all of us by bike, where I ended up buying two six packs of my favorite seasonal beer. Or maybe it’s when I made a quick run from the Midtown Global Market on my fast bike to grab lights and gear for my fat bike for the evening’s ride after a whole day’s worth of riding.</p>
                <p>No, I suppose the start is way before that. My buddy Daniel had been planning on this group bike ride where we bike down to the Minnesota River Bottoms and camp for the night in the snow. It was scheduled weeks in advance, so we had no way of knowing that the middle of December would turn out to be closer to the end of March in weather conditions. We weren’t going to camp in the mud, if only just because it wasn’t our plan, but we were still going to ride the Rivbutts, knowing that it’d be wet instead of snowy.</p>
                <p>I got let in to Freewheel around 6pm after saying goodbye to my daytime group and the nighttime group had already assembled. I only knew Daniel, so it was going to be a lot of newness. Looking at everyone’s setups, I had too much weight on my bike. Yes I was over prepared, but I also had the afternoon’s bike adventure gear in addition to the evening’s all loaded up. My fully loaded Pugsley looked bloated with the double six-pack hauling, U-lock, snack, bike tool stuffed panniers on my rack. The Pug is usually about 29lbs with the 29+ setup I’ve got. The rear end alone was a solid 50lbs starting out.</p>
                <p>We were five leaving from Freewheel Midtown. We pedaled out to the Lake Street light rail station, where the weight of the bike first set in hauling it up the stairs to the train platform.</p>
                <p>The five of us boarded the train and found our group one larger a few stops down. A guy looking suspiciously like my buddy Aaron called Thad strolled on with his fatbike. We were six arriving at American Boulevard station.</p>
                <p>Introductory beers at the trailhead were had and we dove into the woods. The road swooped and dipped and pulled us downhill with a great force, but quietly warned me to know how to avoid getting a mouthful of it in a crash.</p>
                <p>Mud was everywhere. I thought about the early days of this summer when everything was rained out and trails like Theo had dicks tearing through ruining the singletrack, reprehensibly undoing an organization’s heart and soul’s worth of blisters and building. The Bottoms, which in that section I think is actually called the Low Road, were unique in their proximity to the water that gave the trails the Atlantis treatment and reshape them every snow thaw, setting it far outside that sort of grooming and maintenance. And it showed in its grizzly roughness.</p>
                <p>At the bottom, the mud was thick, but negotiable. There was a lot of dark space in front of me and well behind me, almost to the point of being alone. I caught up to folks up ahead, where there was only two more. Doubling back, we learned that one of the guys lost a derailleur hanger in the intro roller coaster and was walking his bike back up to go home. So we were five again.</p>
                <p>Well, given the ebb and flow of the suction slop, we varied between a group of five and isolated silos of survival. Golf balls of clumpy road slapped my front splash guard with the thump of hail while the excess mud barnacles arched forward from the top of my wheel in front of me in a weighty spray. My front wheel was throwing up. Projectile mud vomit.</p>
                <p>The mud got so soft at some points that it was much like riding ice on a flat tire, or driving a speedboat through gallons of melted peanut butter. My rear end drifted back and forth through the gluey patches like that of a car’s during the big chase sequence of an action movie. Eventually, I’d get bucked off by the wild swinging motion of my 50-pounds-and-counting backside and stomp a foot down in the wet chocolate path and brace for impact.</p>
                <p>Then there was the walking. The only time I accumulated the show-stopping mud was during the walking periods. Not enough rotational force to spray off the excess mud collection. This meant that when I walked by my bike because I was unable to ride my bike without falling, that I would be pushing a 60-70lb machine with locked wheels and an unbalanced front and rear. On tractionless uphills.</p>
                <p>We all worked through it differently. Some took it straight down the middle of the path where there was mud, but fewer ruts. Some of us took it slow, pedaling evenly but patiently. Others rode the side of the path through the much bumpier, but also much grippier, reeds and leaves and the occasional tree stump.</p>
                <p>Some would have to stop every few hundred feet to unclog the drain between the tire and the seat stay, the frame and the drivetrain, the fork and the everything. Chains were skipping on anything that had gears and shifting quickly became a game of discovering the spot that only jumped twice per pedal stroke and doing so most predictably.</p>
                <p>Then we found the fire. Three fellow Q employees had set up camp by the south side of the river and had been there for hours. And then we were eight strong. We joined them and joked and told stories over beers and liquor around the heat until 10pm, where it dawned on us that in only a few minutes, we’d have ourselves 10:11pm on December 13, 2014. That is, 10:11 12/13/14. It was decided that something crazy must be done to commemorate it, so a couple dudes in the group disrobed to their birthday suits and cannonballed into the river. They dried out by the fire and slowly put their heavy muddy clothes back on.</p>
                <p>We needed to catch a train home though. We sure as hellfire weren’t going to sleep out there. Well one of them was, but the rest of us had our sights set on a comfy bed for the night. Seven of us left the camp and continued toward the 494 bridge. Packs were formed and lost in cooperation with the trail until that dry zone under the bridge a few miles down. The fog had coated the ground now and its hesitant mist was clouding up the forward visibility. A curse-filled kick through the mud along the side of the tall bridge to find a way up separated us another time. Five got held up way behind as a result of our second catastrophic mechanical failure: another broken derailleur. A twenty-minute regroup and a failed chain repair just meant a new method of getting the leader of this group and his bike back home.</p>
                <p>So on the pedestrian walkway of the 494 bridge, Daniel got a tow from each of us, taking turns skitching off our backpacks or receiving pushes from behind like the dang Tour de France. Miles back to the American Boulevard station, where we laughed at our strange fortune and waited for a late train, which arrived a quarter-to-one in the morning.</p>
                <p>It wasn’t much for us to squeeze onto the train, though most times we were much more in the way than not. After we unloaded the pilots from airport station to airport station, a special guest joined us. At first, he darted onto the train with an “excuse me pardon me” plan in mind. We didn’t react quickly enough to man’s awkward maneuvering, leading him to jump off the train to find another car, but hurriedly dive back onto our door again when running out of time. He leapt in carrying a Harriet Brewing growler in one hand, and playing platform gamer with his feet, somewhere between a nimble stomp and a panicked tiptoe, and stumbled ungracefully through our bikes quickly without warning, garnering himself a healthy dose of wet nature on his slacks. He wasn’t too pleased with it and he let us know, doubling between placing accusations of spite on our bike placement and lack of warning on their muddiness to offering us swigs of his growler and asking us to stop revving our wheels on innocent bystanders with our dirty tires. He was a fun guy to engage once you realized he was drunk and speaking recursively.</p>
                <p>Off at the Lake Street station again, now down to six after another dropped off. Hauled the bike back downstairs and then hauled Daniel’s drivetrain-less bike to the shop in a group. The gents were wonderful enough to open the bike shower up to us to hose off the wrecked machines a bit. Each came out looking damn near brand new, clogging the shower drain by the bucketload in the process. I gave them the last of my beer as thanks for this kindness, fully knowing that at least one of them had to be back at the shop by 9, only a handful of hours away. We parted ways after cleaning up and Daniel assured me, “you know, this is pretty much what I expected from tonight. This isn’t unusual.”</p>
